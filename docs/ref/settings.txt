Available settings
==================

Here's a full list of all available settings, and their default values.

.. setting:: AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE

AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE
-------------------

Default: Not defined.

As specified in the django docs, the site-specific user profile model used by your site.

For a sample application, you can use ``...``

**Is this strictly needed???**

WEBIDPROVIDER_SKIP_PROFILE_INIT
-------------------------------

Default: ``False``

Disables the registered signal that tries to initialize a blank profile when an WebIDUser is created.

WEBIDPROVIDER_PROFILE_INIT_CALLBACK
-----------------------------------

Default: None.

Custom function that gets called for initializing a blank profile. It gets ``user`` passed as keyword argument.


WEBIDPROVIDER_WEBIDURI_CALLBACK
-------------------------------
Default: None

This function is called during the cert creation process, in order to gather the info needed to write the final WebID URI that will go in the **subjectAltName** field in the certificate.

* The callback function is called with the ``WebIDUser`` instance as the only argument.

* Callback should return the final string

* Note: several URIS still not implemented.

* If you do not specify a callback, the certificate constructor will try to reverse a view named ``webidprovider-webiduri``.

Note that your callback DOES NOT need to prepend the "URI:" prefix; it gets added to it.
       
WEBIDPROVIDER_WEBID_OVER_HTTPS
------------------------------
Default: ``False``

This might not be needed finally if we delegate that responsibility to the WEBIDAUTH_WEBIDURI_CALLBACK, but I thought it could simplify things a little bit (specially if we are using the webid profile pattern that we pack with django-webid-provider). Could be bool, or could be ('no', 'optional', 'force') options:

Now: ``False`` for ``http`` or ``True`` for ``https``.

*The following not implemented yet:*

* If no, just URI http://

* If optional, might be sthing like https://...webiduri... , http://...sameuri

* If force: just make sure we have the httpS://prefixed uri...

Might work as a switch, for reusing the same webidauth callback (it interacts with that one in the sense that it is called from inside there, or it modifies / double checks its output.

WEBIDPROVIDER_CREATE_USER
-------------------------

*(not implemented yet)*

Default: ``True``

Tells if a new user should be created without further restrictions when using the webid user registration forms.
Here we have to specify more options:

* Create user with no usable passoword (it will only allow webidlogins)

* Create user with usable password during the WebIDUser creation process.

* Ony allow WebID profile and cert creation for pre-existing users.

WEBIDPROVIDER_CHECK_EMAIL
-------------------------
*(not implemented)*

*Maybe we do not need the "webidprovider" bit and we can use some of the django-profile settings...*

If ``True``, it will need a confirmation token sent by email before activating the WebID User.

Apache config

**TBD**
