*** Eventually I will move many of the tests here to the python-webid
*** cert-generation tests.

1) Write test for KeyGen CERT creation
	- We can control serial number since it's the first one in the db.
	- We need to take control also of the DATETIME object (allow overriding).
- Check that, with the same spkac, it gives the same cert object (fingerprint and so on).
- Check that, if tampering wight Challenge, cert will fail.
- Check that, if bad signature, verify cert will fail
